# Test Cases
--------------------


1) To Tally the distinct states in both the final table (three column) generated from state wise and five column table
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>> select distinct(state) from  finaltest_table1;  // Answer: 36
>> select distinct(detected_state) from fivetable1;  // Answer: 36

2) To check a record to show that the input used matches with the final record
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>> select * from columnfive where date_announced = '25-03-2021';

output:
25-03-2021	Manipur	2	-1	NULL

>> select * from raw where date_announced = '25-03-2021';

output:
545378	25-03-2021	Imphal West	Manipur	MN	-1	Hospitalized
545379	25-03-2021	Imphal East	Manipur	MN	2	Hospitalized
545380	25-03-2021	Bishnupur	Manipur	MN	1	Hospitalized
545381	25-03-2021		Manipur	MN	-1	Recovered

Thus, we can conclude that the data recovered from the five column table tells us a sum of confirmed, recvovered and deceased.
So, this is the only value negative in the whole list and is matching with the input file in recovered section as the hospitalised value is changed into the confirmed.

3) Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu data absent in final table due to mismatch (year 2020 in statewise and 2021 in raw data) in two sets thus, creating a new table for data of daman and diu.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

create external table ddt(date_announced string, detected_state string, positive int, negative int, deceased int) row format delimited fields terminated by ',' stored as textfile;
insert into table ddt select * from columnfive where detected_state = 'Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu';
select * from ddt;
